# ProfitMoneyDiagram

In economics and finance, *arbitrage* is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices.

**Profit/Money Diagram** is an application that gets data about current bids and asks from various crypto-currency markets and: 
- Displays optimal profit that we can get from arbitrage and amount of money we need to do this
- Builds diagram of amount-profit points
- Shows list of deals that should be made to get optimal profit

Here "optimal" means not too risky.
